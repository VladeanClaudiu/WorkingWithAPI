## Color Scheme Generator

This is a solution to a solo project from [Scrimba](https://www.scrimba.com).
This was my a very fun project to work on.
Solo projects are meant to challenge the skills you've learnt so far through the courses; there is no solution given by Scrimba.

## The challenge

- There needs to be a color picker and when you choose the color this has to create a 'seed color'
- The seed color you need to send to the Color API along with a color scheme mode
- Clicking the button 'get color scheme' makes a request to The Color API and returns a number of HEX values which represent the colors in your scheme
- Once you get the HEX values you display the colors and the HEX values on the page
- Stretch goal: click HEX values to copy to clipboard

## Built with
