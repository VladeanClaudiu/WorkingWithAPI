## Movie Watchlist

This is a solution to a solo project from [Scrimba](https://www.scrimba.com).
Solo projects are meant to challenge the skills you've learnt so far through the courses; there is no solution given by Scrimba.

## The challenge

- Two pages: index.html & watchlist.html
- The index page is the search page; when you click 'search' it will call to the OMDB API with the title that you searched for and display the search results
- Each search result has a button 'add to watchlist' which saves the data to local storage
- Watchlist.html loads and displays data from the local storage

## Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties 
- CSS Grid, CSS Flexbox
- JavaScript
- [OMDB API](https://www.omdbapi.com/)
- Figma design files from Scrimba
